/// MembraneRTC client.
///
/// The client is responsible for relaying MembraneRTC Engine specific messages through given reliable transport layer.
/// Once initialized, the client is responsbile for exchaning necessary messages via provided `EventTransport` and managing underlying
/// `RTCPeerConnection`. The goal of the client is to be as lean as possible, meaning that all activies regarding the session such as moderating
/// should be implemented by the user himself on top of the `MembraneRTC`.
///
/// The user's ability of interacting with the client is greatly liimited to the essential actions such as joining/leaving the session,
/// adding/removing local tracks and receiving information about remote peers and their tracks that can be played by the user.
///
/// User can request 3 different types of local tracks that will get forwareded to the server by the client:
/// - `LocalAudioTrack` - an audio track utilizing device's microphone
/// - `LocalVideoTrack` - a video track that can utilize device's camera or if necessay use video playback from a file (useful for testing with a simulator)
/// - `LocalBroadcastScreenTrack` - a screencast track taking advantage of `Broadcast Upload Extension` to record device's screen even if the app is minimized
///
/// It is recommended to request necessary audio and video tracks before joining the room but it does not mean it can't be done afterwards (in case of screencast)
///
/// Once the user created the MembraneRTC client and connected to the server transport layer they can call the `connect` method to initialize joining the session.
/// After receiving `onConnected` a user will receive notification about various peers joining/leaving the session, new tracks being published and ready for playback
/// or going inactive.
